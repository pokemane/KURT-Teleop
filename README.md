## Teleop RC-car
The goal of this project is to control an RC car via remote location using an on-board camera and video transmission system.
The car also sports an onboard IMU with accelerometer and wireless capability, and is controlled from a remote PC using LabVIEW to integrate a video game force-feedback steering wheel with pedals, with a low-latency first-person video transmission from the car.

Code and LabVIEW libs, resources, etc are used solely for educational purposes, using all applicable licenses and restrictions.
